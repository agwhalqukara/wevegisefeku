The 28-year-old sent several messages to Patton, a former classmate, just minutes later, and shortly before carrying out her 14-minute killing spree.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to NewsChannel 5,</a> Hale referenced a past post in her message to Patton, which was sent from a since-deleted Instagram account under the name “Aiden.”</p><p>“So basically that post I made on here about you, that was basically a suicide note. I’m planning to die today,” the message stated.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Averianna Patton called 911 after getting suicidal messages from Nashville school shooter Audrey Hale before the massacre.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hale killed six people in a shooting at the Covenant School. <span class=credit>Metro Nashville Police Department via ZUMA Press Wire</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Patton contacted the Metro Nashville Police Department after first calling the suicide hotline for her friend. <span class=credit>WZTV</span></figure><p>“THIS IS NOT A JOKE!!! … You’ll probably hear about me on the news after I die.”</p><p>Hale added: “This is my last goodbye. I love you … See you again in another life.”</p><p>Patton responded by telling Hale she had “so much more life to live.”</p><p>Hale responded: &nbsp;“I know but I don’t want to live. I’m so sorry. I’m not trying to upset you or get attention. I just need to die. I wanted to tell you first because you are the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen and known all my life.</p><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>3</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p class="ad__label ad__label--top">Advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/NYPICHPDPICT000008884513-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/NYPICHPDPICT000008884515-2.jpg><p><span class=screen-reader-text>Advertisement</span></p><p>“My family doesn’t know what I’m about to do.
