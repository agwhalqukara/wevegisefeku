The couple once used a combined Instagram account, but recently, they decided to separate their accounts so they could each post more of their interests. Fans have wondered when Duggar would change her handle, and the day has finally come.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Joy-Anna-Duggar-Austin-Forsyth.png><h2>Joy Duggar and Austin Forsyth have more than 1 million Instagram followers</h2><p id=par-2_46>For years, Duggar was <a href=#>overshadowed by her older sisters</a>. She was a bit too young to be grouped with Jinger, Jessa, Jill, and Jana, but a little too old to hang around with Michelle and Jim Bob’s four youngest daughters. However, in recent years, Duggar has become more well known.</p><p id=par-3_67>Once Duggar married Austin Forsyth when she was 19, she became more closely profiled on the show, and fans grew to know her and like her. She and Forsyth welcomed their first child in 2018, and slowly, her social media presence started growing in response to her storyline becoming a more important part of filming. Today, and she Forsyth have more than one million Instagram followers.</p><h2>The two can share more of their own interests on separate accounts</h2><p id=par-4_50>Earlier this year, Duggar and Forsyth decided to separate their accounts. Some of the Duggar couples share an account, while other, more high-profile Duggars (such as Jill, Jessa, and Jinger) have accounts separate from their husbands. Joy Duggar decided to join that club, and a few months back, Forsyth started his own account.</p><p id=par-5_54>Forsyth’s account has become a place where he can <a href=#>showcase his contracting work</a>. He teaches fans about construction and shows off the homes he builds and remodels through his business, and posts plenty of images of his son. Duggar’s account now is a place where she can post photos of her own hobbies.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2>Duggar had told fans that changing her name was a slow process</h2><p id=par-6_34>When Forsyth first created his own account, Duggar’s social media handle remained “austinandjoyforsyth.” When fans asked why she hadn’t changed it, she explained that she was trying, <a href=#>but it was a slow process</a>.</p><p id=par-7_56>Duggar and Forsyth have a verified account, and rumor has it that changing the handle on a verified account can take months, since it’s a more difficult process than someone simply switching their username. In mid-July, Duggar’s process of changing her name finally ended; she’s officially “joy4site” — the same format as her husband’s account.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><h2>It’s unclear what the next chapter is for the couple</h2><p id=par-8_69>Duggar and Forsyth have stopped filming for Counting On. The two did appear in the family game night during the season premiere, and they discussed losing their baby at 20 weeks. But fans noticed the couple wasn’t in the promo for the new season, and after a lot of speculation that Forsyth isn’t comfortable in front of the camera, it appears the two are leaving Counting On behind.</p><p id=par-9_51>The next chapter remains unclear. Duggar and Forsyth are preparing <a href=#>to welcome their second child</a>, and it’s possible the two could be eyeing some kind of house-flipping spinoff show, since Forsyth’s remodeling skills seem to be highlighted more on social media. For now, though, they’re stepping away from the cameras. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwsMHNraCnn12ku262zrJkna2XnK6zecWipZqknK56pLTAp56eq12dsrN5yKeqrZmXp66uec2apJ5mmKm6rXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoy-duggar-finally-changes-her-instagram-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoy-duggar-finally-changes-her-instagram-name.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoy-duggar-finally-changes-her-instagram-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoy-duggar-finally-changes-her-instagram-name.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoy-duggar-finally-changes-her-instagram-name.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoy-duggar-finally-changes-her-instagram-name.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./richard-buckley-s-husband-tom-ford-with-a-net-worth-of-500-million-shares-a-son-named-alexander.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./richard-buckley-s-husband-tom-ford-with-a-net-worth-of-500-million-shares-a-son-named-alexander.html>Richard Buckley's husband, Tom Ford with a net worth of $500 million shares a son named, Alexander.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ibm-net-worth-2024.html>IBM Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ibm-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
