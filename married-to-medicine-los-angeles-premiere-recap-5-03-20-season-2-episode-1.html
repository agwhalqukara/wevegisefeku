Jasmin Johnson and Shanique Drummond are both doctor’s wives. They’re also really good friends. They hang out all the time and Shanique was the first to see Jasmin’s new rental. Jasmin’s new home is spectacular. It has these amazing views of the city and Jasmin was really proud of her place. She had furniture in her new home herself. She took pride in what she chose and so she couldn’t wait to that show off as well, but he also couldn’t wait to talk about her concierge business. Jasmin went into business for herself. She wants to prove that she’s more than a doctor’s wife and so she started her own concierge business. And it was just taking off.</p><p>There was also Dr. Britten Cole. She is now back in town and it’s for good. Britten moved to LA with her family. She had found a job as an anesthesiologist and so that made up her mind for her. She had to move. It’s what was best for her career and her family. She’s now enjoying her time in the city and she’s watching on as her husband struggles to acclimate. He has gone all-LA on her. He’s still finding places to work out and he’s been getting comfortable. It was different for Britten because she was out in LA before. She was there for a while as she looked for a job and so she’s made friends. She knows the other ladies very well.</p><p>Britten also has some friends from out of town that was coming in. Her friends from the Atlanta version of “Married to Medicine” have come out to party with the LA crew. They first went to Jasmin’s rental. They looked around at her new place and admire the views as well as the wine bar. Dr. Heavenly as it turns out had really liked Jasmin. She hadn’t thought much of Jasmin when she first met her and now that’s all different. She admires Jasmin’s hustle. She also respects her as a fellow entrepreneur. Heavenly likes Jasmin. She doesn’t understand why some of the others have had a problem with her.</p><p>Heavenly was thinking about Dr. Imani Walker. She knows there’s been an issue between Imani and Jasmin and she doesn’t get it. She admires Imani. Imani was a therapist. She was also an extremely beautiful woman who many respect and even slightly fear. There was no need for Imani to have an issue with Jasmin and surprisingly she wasn’t the only one to do so. Many of the doctors look down at the doctor’s wives. They see them as less than and that’s what inspired Jasmin to do something for herself. Britten thinks Jasmin and Shanique have way too much free time on their hands. Imani tends not to think much of them and so Heavenly asked her about it.</p><p>Heavenly asked Imani what her problem with Jasmin was. She wanted to hear from Imani what was at the root of her issue with another woman and Imani told her about the house thing. She had looked at Jasmin’s house and she had claimed it looked like a drug dealer’s home. Jasmin had taken exception to that because she didn’t want anyone to accuse her black husband of being a drug dealer. She told Imani that her husband’s level of success and Imani were different. She had tried to put Imani in her place and Imani has never forgotten it. Both women detest each other. They weren’t going to get into a fight or anything. They just weren’t going to be friends.</p><p>The Atlanta ladies tried to change that. They mentioned to both Imani and Jasmin that they could put all this hostility behind them and neither woman was all that interested. Jasmin was focused on other things. Like how she wanted to drum up business for herself. Jasmin wanted to impress the Atlanta ladies because she knew they would refer people to her and that’s what her concierge business relies on. Jasmin put together a cocktail party. She invited everyone to it and Dr. Kendra Segura came. She came in a crop top. She had a baby three months ago and she still showed off her stomach which was not flat.</p><p>Kendra also talked about her husband. She told everyone that he was Chinese and Heavenly had asked an ignorant question. She had asked if Kendra’s Chinese husband had a small penis, but then she got defensive when Kendra was pointing out how ignorant she sounded and so that kicked off a thing between them. Kendra called Heavenly a bitch. Heavenly accused Kendra of being insecure about her man. Kendra got up. It had taken Jasmin to escort Kendra for there not to be a fight and the ladies all had to step in to get Kendra to calm down. Jasmin would have liked to see a fight between them and she only got in the way because she didn’t want anyone to forget about her concierge business.</p><p>Only Heavenly wasn’t done there. She stirred up more trouble because she had invited Imani to the cocktail party and Imani later chose to be petty. Imani walked into Jasmin’s house and she ignored her. She ignored the hostess. She greeted literally everyone else before she paid Jasmin even the slightest attention. Quad noticed it. Quad was the first person to bring up and not the last. The other ladies tried to step in as well. They tried to repair the relationship between Imani and Jasmin and instead the ladies made it worse.</p><p>Imani apologized again. Her last apology was called childish and so Britten tried to stand up for her. Britten and Quad got into an argument about it.</p><p>And, well, the ladies loved to fight and argue.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWlnnZa%2Fs7XEnWStp12isqW1wqKlnmWcpMBurc2gnKWdo2K9s7HMopyrnV2nsqStz2ZsZmhjYn9xedKemKynnmJ%2FbrHPoqqonJVifnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarried-to-medicine-los-angeles-premiere-recap-5-03-20-season-2-episode-1.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmarried-to-medicine-los-angeles-premiere-recap-5-03-20-season-2-episode-1.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmarried-to-medicine-los-angeles-premiere-recap-5-03-20-season-2-episode-1.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmarried-to-medicine-los-angeles-premiere-recap-5-03-20-season-2-episode-1.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarried-to-medicine-los-angeles-premiere-recap-5-03-20-season-2-episode-1.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarried-to-medicine-los-angeles-premiere-recap-5-03-20-season-2-episode-1.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./martin-spanjers-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./martin-spanjers-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>Martin Spanjers Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./demi-lovato-height-how-tall-is-demi-lovato.html>Demi Lovato Height How Tall is Demi Lovato?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./demi-lovato-height-how-tall-is-demi-lovato.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
