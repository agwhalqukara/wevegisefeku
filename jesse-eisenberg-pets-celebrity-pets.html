The festival hosted a debate on if dogs or cats are superior. Obviously on “Team Cats”, Eisenberg couldn’t attend so he <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>made this video</a>, where he claimed he couldn’t be there in person because he was on vacation in Hawaii with Mr. Trunkles. While Jesse’s cat, Mr. Trunkles, did not provide his own quote, we’re sure he would agree with Eisenberg’s comments.</p><p>In the video, Eisenberg said, “I’ve always just had cats as companions, which is what Mr. Trunkles is. He is my cat companion. He’s so great. And he’s also my best friend. I know. I know, it’s totally corny to say that, my cat’s my best friend. But in my case I think it’s actually true, you know.”</p><p>Jesse Eisenberg doesn’t just reserve his affection for the silver screen; he extends it to felines in need as well. He routinely opens his home to abandoned and stray cats, providing them with temporary shelter until they land in their permanent abodes. It’s as if his box office successes translate into more opportunities to foster kitties, amplifying his impact both in Hollywood and in the world of cat rescue.</p><h2 class=single__celeb-profile__title>Jesse Eisenberg</h2><a href=# class=cpw_fancybox><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jesse-Eisenberg-Pets-e1676132360802-250x250.jpg alt="Jesse Eisenberg Pets" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h4>Birthday</h4><p>October 5, 1983 (40)</p><p>New York City</p><p>Jesse Eisenberg is an American actor, playwright, and author. He was born in New York City and grew up in East Brunswick, New Jersey. Eisenberg began acting in school plays at a young age and went on to study at The New School in New York City. He made his film debut in the late 1990s and rose to prominence in the mid-2000s with his roles in films such as “The Squid and the Whale” and “Adventureland.” Eisenberg is perhaps best known for his portrayal of <a href=#>Mark Zuckerberg</a> in the 2010 film “The Social Network,” for which he received critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.</p><p>Jesse Eisenberg’s body of work spans various genres, from drama to comedy, including films such as “Zombieland,” “Adventureland,” and “Now You See Me.” His role in “The Social Network” earned him critical acclaim, while his performance in <a href=#>Woody Allen</a>‘s “To Rome with Love” showed his range as an actor. Eisenberg’s talent for playing complex characters also extends to theater, with plays like “The Spoils,” which he not only starred in but also wrote. In addition to his acting work, Eisenberg is also an accomplished writer, having published a collection of short stories and several plays.</p><p>Eisenberg’s career has seen collaborations with an impressive range of artists and celebrities. His association with filmmaker <a href=#>David Fincher</a> led to the game-changing role in “The Social Network,” while teaming up with Woody Allen resulted in the lighthearted “To Rome with Love.” Working with Ruben Fleischer brought about the comedic gem “Zombieland,” which also featured actors like <a href=#>Woody Harrelson</a> and <a href=#>Emma Stone</a>. In “Now You See Me,” Eisenberg worked alongside <a href=#>Mark Ruffalo</a>, <a href=#>Isla Fisher</a>, Woody Harrelson, and <a href=#>Morgan Freeman</a>, to name a few. His work in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” had him share screen space with <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>, <a href=#>Henry Cavill</a>, and <a href=#>Gal Gadot</a>. He also collaborated with <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a> in “American Ultra” and “Adventureland,” showcasing a different kind of on-screen chemistry. Eisenberg has worked with directors like Kelly Reichardt in “Night Moves” and Joachim Trier in “Louder Than Bombs,” further diversifying his filmography.</p><p>Jesse Eisenberg has received a Best Actor nomination from the Academy Awards for “The Social Network.” He also received a BAFTA nomination for the same role. Not to be overlooked are his nominations from the Golden Globe Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards, which again emphasized his performance in “The Social Network.” He won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor for his role in “The Social Network.”</p><span class=single__post-summary__social__label>More Jesse Eisenberg</span><ul class=single__post-summary__social__value><li class=icontwitter><a href=# title="Jesse Eisenberg's Twitter"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/themes/cpw_live/images/twitter-icon.png alt="Jesse Eisenberg's Twitter" fetchpriority=high style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCpnaSoe6%2Bx02innqyjZLemv9KeZJ6ho5q7o7HRoGSpnaSofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjesse-eisenberg-pets-celebrity-pets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjesse-eisenberg-pets-celebrity-pets.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjesse-eisenberg-pets-celebrity-pets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjesse-eisenberg-pets-celebrity-pets.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjesse-eisenberg-pets-celebrity-pets.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjesse-eisenberg-pets-celebrity-pets.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jessica-rose.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jessica-rose.html>Jessica Rose</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./5-albums-we-cannot-wait-to-hear-in-2020.html>5 Albums We CANNOT Wait To Hear in 2020!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./5-albums-we-cannot-wait-to-hear-in-2020.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
