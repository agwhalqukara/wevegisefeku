<time>13 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>As we approach the end of what has been a pretty MAJOR year in music, we here at <a href=#><strong>CelebMix</strong></a> can’t help but now look forward to the next!</p><p>2019 may have given us new music from the likes of Selena Gomez, Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran as well as monster hit singles <strong>Señorita</strong>, <strong>Old Town Road</strong> and <strong>You Need To Calm Down</strong>, but with so many new upcoming projects already scheduled for release, 2020 looks set to be just as dynamic and just as exciting!</p><p>Here are our picks of the 5 albums we simply cannot wait to hear in the new year…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>THE 1975 ‘NOTES ON A CONDITIONAL FORM’<br>Release Date: February 21st, 2020</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/b80d2d523cb87ac5b6c928d3303b9ac0.1000x1000x1.jpg><p>Wilmslow’s finest <strong>The 1975</strong> are to return in the New Year with their highly anticipated fourth studio album Notes On A Conditional Form.</p><p>Released through <strong>Dirty Hit</strong> and <strong>Polydor Records</strong>, the LP will feature 22 tracks including hit singles People, Frail State Of Mind and The 1975, a collaboration with 16-year old environmental activist <strong>Greta Thunberg</strong>.</p><p>Exploring and addressing universal themes and issues such as mental health, domesticity and lost love, band frontman <strong>Matt Healy</strong> teases the album will be a complete departure from 2018’s A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships with the group adopting a “sort of emo” more “homely” sound<span> this time around.</span></p><p><span>A band known for capturing the mood and feeling of </span>a generation, with their own unique style of woke pop/rock music, <span>we are beyond excited to hear what Matt, Adam, Ross and George have been working on when the album is released in February of next year.</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HALSEY ‘MANIC’<br>Release Date: January 17th, 2020</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1ccc88afcd13131dc35a1bd028922dbc748a55fb.jpeg><p>Following on from the release of hit singles Without Me, Graveyard and Clementine, American singer <strong>Halsey</strong> is readying herself for the launch of her brand new album, Manic in January!</p><p><span>Fusing together a diverse range of musical genres to create an eclectic mix of hip-hop/rock/country and pop style tracks, the album is said to be set in a “dystopian fantasy world” that will reflect New Jersey native Halsey’s current state of mind and views on the world</span> as we enter a brand new decade.</p><p>An artist on the cusp on greatness – taking risks, breaking boundaries and finding her own place in this crazy world of pop, Manic looks set to be a BIG hit for Halsey make no mistake about it!</p><h2>LOUIS TOMLINSON ‘WALLS’<br>Release Date: January 31st, 2020</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/louis-tomlinson-walls-album-artwork-1.png><p>As the final member of <strong>One Direction</strong> to go solo, <strong>Louis Tomlinson</strong> has been methodical and meticulous in the planning and production of his debut solo album, Walls&nbsp;– taking his time to ensure that what he creates is an authentic sound that truly reflects who his is as an artist in his own right.</p><p>Featuring the singles Two Of Us, Kill My Mind and We Made It, lyrically the album is sure to be a powerful rollercoaster of emotions, as Tomlinson bravely opens up and reflects upon some of the hardships and struggles he’s faced in recent years.</p><p>“In general, I’m just wearing my heart on my sleeve.” Louis tells <a href=#>Billboard</a> when describing the album. “I always try to be as honest as possible – once fans have heard the album, they will see a slightly different side of me.”</p><p>By turning his broken heart into a musical piece of art, Walls is Louis Tomlinson coming of age, taking control of his narrative and sharing his truth with the world, proving that no matter what life imposes onto you, you don’t have to give up!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>LOUISE ‘HEAVY LOVE’<br>Release Date: January 17th, 2020</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Louise-Heavy-Love--1024x1024.jpg><p>British pop princess <strong>Louise</strong> is set to continue her spectacular return to music in 2020, with the release of her first album in almost 20 years, Heavy Love.</p><p>Having delighted fans old and new throughout 2019 with the release of tracks Stretch, Small Talk, Lead Me On, Breaking Back Together and Not The Same the former <strong>Eternal</strong> star proves she is still a fierce musical force to be reckoned with, having taken full, creative control of her art, producing some of the years BEST pop singles!</p><p>After retreating to the recording studio back in 2017, finding solace and comfort in her love of making music following a period of uncertainty in personal life, Louise is back stronger, smarter, braver and wiser than ever before – embracing her life wholeheartedly, describing Heavy Love as an ‘upbeat’ and ’empowering’ record that celebrates and tells the tale of a woman coming into her own.</p><p>An album created for anybody searching to re-find their purpose and reclaim their identity, Louise has a story to tell and we cannot wait to hear it!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>THE KILLERS ‘IMPLODING THE MIRAGE’<br>Release Date: TBC</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SharedImage-96979-1024x1024.jpg><p>Serving as the follow up to 2017’s Wonderful, Wonderful – <strong>The Killers</strong> are gearing up to release their brand new album, Imploding The Mirage, in the Spring of 2020.</p><p>Though little is known of the bands 6th LP, potential song titles rumoured to feature on the record were teased in a post on the official Killers <a href=#>Instagram</a> page last month&nbsp;– where names such as Blowback, Party People, When Dreams Run Dry and Man + Woman all appeared scribbled down on a white board accompanied by large red ticks, circles and stars.</p><p>Having worked on the project for over 12 months in the US Western state of Utah, the very same place where Killers frontman <strong>Brandon Flowers</strong> <a href=#>admits</a> he first fell in love with the art of making music, the group promise fans a more ‘fun, grateful’ sounding concept-like album inspired by their collective musical DNA and synthesiser music.</p><p>No matter the sound and whatever the lyrical content, Imploding The Mirage is almost sure to be a fire smash for the much loved American band.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Which albums are you most looking forward to listening to in 2020?
